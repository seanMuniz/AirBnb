In this project, I had the opportunity to learn and apply Swift to create a functional iOS application. 
One of the key takeaways of this project was understanding how to create views that can be reused
across other parts of the app. By modularizing these views, I learned the importance of code organization, which 
could help other developers to understand the the project, and its source code better. Additionally, 
I was able to empathize with potential users as I had to implement the navigation flows of the app. During this process
I learned how to use Swift's navigation system such as using 'NavigationLink', to transfer data from one screen
to another screen. Overall, this experience deepend my understanding of UI/UX design principles and how 
they impact user interaction.
